# ICON DETECTION USING YOLO v4

In this projecet, I used the darknet YOLO open source, which has been build by `AlexeyAB` 

## Installation
Before running this app, you have to have these libraries to run it successfully
- `imgaug` : use to generate data for traning model
- `imgageio` and `cv2`: use to read, write, pre-process the images and write the label bbox on them 
- `labelImg` and `PyQt5`: use to set up labels manually

Then, you need to download some files from `AlexeyAB/darknet` repository to get the config file and make file:
- [Configuration file](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov4-custom.cfg)
- [Make file](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/Makefile)

## Usage

- HOME
